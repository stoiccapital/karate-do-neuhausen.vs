# Copy Blueprint

## Prime Directive

Enforce deterministic, unambiguous copy generation across all landing pages. Eliminate creativity, variability, hype, and stylistic drift by defining immutable linguistic rules.

## Scope

Governs language, tone, sentence structure, headline patterns, value proposition construction, feature schemas, benefit articulation, CTA phrasing, and copy density.

## Non-Negotiable Laws

Tone MUST be direct, factual, authoritative, and outcome-driven. Voice MUST be consistent across every section. Copy MUST avoid emotional or creative language. No adjectives without measurable meaning. No metaphors, humor, storytelling, or rhetorical questions.

Every page MUST follow the messaging flow: Problem → Value → Features → Outcomes → Proof → CTA. Every section MUST express one primary idea only. Every sentence MUST serve a functional purpose. No duplicate claims allowed anywhere on the page. All claims MUST be true, verifiable, and backed by product capabilities.

There MUST be one H1 only, located in the Hero section. H1 MUST use one of the approved headline templates: Outcome-first, Pain-relief, Transformation-result. H1 MUST NOT exceed the maximum character limit defined in design tokens. All H2s MUST be functional labels that introduce the section's purpose. Headlines MUST express a single idea with zero filler.

Value props MUST be user-centric (never product-centric). Each value prop MUST follow the VP schema: Benefit → Why it matters → Measurable or logical outcome. Value props MUST avoid vague phrases. No value prop may exceed 2 sentences. Value props MUST map directly to core features.

Each feature MUST follow the Feature Schema: What it is → How it works → What outcome it enables. Feature summaries MUST be 1 sentence. Bullet points MUST be outcome-oriented, not descriptive. No feature may introduce technical jargon unless audience-specific. No feature block may exceed 4 bullets.

Benefits MUST be specific, tangible, and directly connected to product capabilities. Outcomes MUST describe end results the user experiences. No abstract or generic benefits allowed. Outcome statements MUST avoid absolute guarantees. Minimum one benefit MUST map to each feature.

Testimonials MUST include: Person or company, Context or role, Problem, Outcome or result. No anonymous testimonials allowed unless explicitly permitted. No vague praise. Metrics MUST be used when available. Social proof MUST reinforce value props.

CTA MUST be direct and action-oriented. Allowed CTA structures: Start + outcome, Get + value, Try + product. Primary CTAs MUST be 2–6 words. Secondary CTAs MUST be passive informational prompts. Explicitly allowed secondary CTA: "Learn more". No creative CTAs allowed.

Hero section MUST follow: H1 → 1 short sentence → CTA group. No paragraph may exceed the maximum line-length token. No section may contain more than 2 paragraphs. Bullet lists MUST NOT exceed 6 items. Testimonials MUST NOT exceed 3 sentences.

All copy MUST achieve clarity over persuasion. No negative manipulation or exaggerated pain statements. No promises of guaranteed results. Every claim MUST be supported by an actual feature. Reading level MUST remain within approved clarity band.

## Decision Hierarchy

When rules conflict, hierarchy MUST be respected in this order: Truthfulness, Clarity, Structural integrity, Outcome orientation, Persuasive strength.

## Process / Flow

Product inputs MUST be validated before copy generation begins. H1 generation MUST use allowed templates only. Hero text MUST be one sentence only. Value propositions MUST use VP schema. Feature blocks MUST use Feature Schema. Benefit and outcome statements MUST be generated. Social proof MUST use testimonial schema. CTA group MUST follow CTA rules. Copy density MUST be validated and redundancies eliminated. Clarity, truthfulness, and structure compliance MUST be enforced.

## Forbidden Patterns

Creative writing, emotional hype, metaphors or analogies, overpromising, overly long paragraphs, multiple ideas per sentence, weak phrases, generic benefits without context, jargon without need, CTA improvisation.

## Output Requirements

GPT MUST output all section copy in canonical order, headlines following allowed templates, value props using schema, feature blocks using schema, benefit/outcome mapping, social proof blocks, CTA set. No styling, no design, no code.

## Quality Gate

Before completing, GPT MUST verify: All copy follows schemas, all claims reflect real product capabilities, no forbidden patterns appear, no redundancy across sections, all CTAs follow CTA laws, all headlines comply with headline rules, tone is consistent and factual, full alignment with Meta-SOP.

## Failure Modes

This SOP fails when: Copy becomes inconsistent across pages, tone drifts into hype or creativity, claims are vague or unsubstantiated, CTAs drift outside allowed patterns, copy density exceeds limits, headlines contain multiple ideas.

## Definition of Done

Copy is complete when: All required sections contain compliant copy, all schemas are respected, zero ambiguity remains, language is deterministic, factual, and outcome-driven, fully compatible with Architecture and Design SOPs, GPT can generate infinite landing-page copy with identical quality.
